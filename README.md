# JavaLLM - A Simple "Language Model" in Java

This repository contains the source code for a basic "LLM" (Language Model) written in Java. This is an educational project and does not leverage true machine learning or artificial intelligence techniques.

## Project Goal

Simulate a simple "LLM" by building a program that generates text based on a defined set of rules and patterns.

## Getting Started

- **Clone this repository:** `git clone https://github.com/juancabe/JavaLLM.git`
- **Open the project** in your preferred Java IDE.
- **Ensure you have the required dependencies** (if any).
- **Run the Main class** to execute the program.

## Functionality

- The program should accept user input or utilize a predefined dataset for text generation.
- Based on the input, the program should generate new text by following the defined rules and patterns.

## Project Deliverables

- A Java class containing the core logic of the "LLM".
- A Main class demonstrating the program's functionality.

## Further Enhancements (Optional)

- Implement different text generation algorithms (e.g., Markov chains).
- Allow for user-defined rules and patterns.
- Integrate the "LLM" with a user interface for interactive text generation.
